## [Programming POE](https://github.com/ST10067040/ProgrammingPOE), [ST10067040](mailto:st10067040@vcconnect.edu.za)

#### I have precompiled both jars for you to test, you can find them in the [releases](https://github.com/ST10067040/ProgrammingPOE/releases) tab, or in the project under `target/`
#### The reason there are 2 jar files is, because you said my original one is too complex, so I made a second one for you to mark part one with.
### Usages:
#### Simple POE (Please use this one for marking part one)
```
java -jar SimplePOE_ST10067040.jar
```
#### Complex POE (Check this one out, as im going to be using it for the rest of the POE)
```
java -jar ComplexPOE_ST10067040.jar
```
##### Please make sure you run this command in the same directory as the jar!
