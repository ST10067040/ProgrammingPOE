## [Programming POE](https://github.com/ST10067040/ProgrammingPOE), [ST10067040](mailto:st10067040@vcconnect.edu.za)

#### I have precompiled a jar for you to test, you can find it in the [releases](https://github.com/ST10067040/ProgrammingPOE/releases) tab, or in the project under `target/`
#### The reason there are 2 jar files is, because you said my original one is too complex, so I made a second one for you to mark part one with.
### Usages:
#### POE (Please use this one for marking part three)
```
java -jar POE_ST10067040.jar
```

##### Please make sure you run this command in the same directory as the jar!
